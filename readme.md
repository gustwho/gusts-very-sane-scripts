# **G**ust's very **S**ane scripts
## Features
- ui that will make me throw up
- almost no scripts
- its all in one place though
- self-made compiler cuz some of em couldnt read the Gui2Lua code without giving errors that make no sense

byfron made me port my stuff to mobile

## how to use
- TODO: update this once it comes public

## current ported scripts
- Velocity Controller: wanna make it look like you're walking while on platform stand/stunned? here you go
- Follow: title
- Simple: platform stand/sit/freeze

### it shouldnt be too hard to make your own custom script here
